# FakeNewsDetector

In this project, we employ a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM-based deep learning model to automatically detect fake news in a news corpus. This technology can be valuable for media organizations seeking automated fake news prediction, reducing the need for manual review of numerous news articles.
